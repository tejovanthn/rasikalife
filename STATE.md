Single next step, kept current. Everything else lives in `docs/plans/`.

## Active: artist profile redesign

Plan: `docs/plans/260722-01-artist-profile-redesign.md` (revised 2026-07-22 against the codebase).

**Next step:** phase 2 — the `ArtistMembership` junction (entity, client functions, tRPC router), member find-or-create routed through the phase 0b dedup helper, and `mergeArtist` fixups for membership rows in both directions.

### Phase status

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0a | Artist write auth: tighten `create`/`update` to editor, `delete` to moderator + soft delete | done |
| 0b | Shared dedup helper; `mergeArtist` gaps (`ArtistAward`, `gurus[]`); artist-rename name-copy cascade | done |
| 0c | Drop `fromItrans` from artist read paths | done |
| 1 | Artist attributes, `EventArtist.isFeatured`, `Image` 'artist', admin CSV columns | done |
| 2 | `ArtistMembership` junction | next |
| 3 | `ArtistPhoto` gallery entity | not started |
| 4 | Collaborator engine + `rebuild-collaborators` backfill sweep | not started |
| 5 | Create/edit wizard (moderator-only, direct write) | not started |
| 6 | Presentation redesign + JSON-LD + gallery subroute | not started |
| 7 | Photo enrichment incl. OG compositing in `packages/og-image` | not started |
| 8 | Claims + verification queue | not started |
| 9 | Polish | not started |

### What phase 0 landed

- **0a** — `artist.create`/`update` now require editor, `delete` requires moderator and soft-deletes. Previously any logged-in user could hard-delete an artist.
- **0c** — artist and composer names no longer pass through `fromItrans`. Raga names, tala names, composition titles and lyrics still do; the split is per field.
- **0b** — `packages/core/src/domain/artist/dedup.ts` holds the shared find-or-create, now backing the event router's `resolveArtist`. `cascadeArtistMerge` migrates `ArtistAward` rows and rewrites `gurus[]` on other artists. New `cascadeArtistNameUpdate` refreshes `EventArtist.artistName` and `ArtistAward.artistName` on rename.
- **1** — new Artist fields (`instrument`, `city`, `practiceStartYear`, `debutYear`, `photoUrl`, `photoUploadId`, `isGroup`, plus entity-only `claimStatus`/`verifiedAt`), widened `gurus`, `EventArtist.isFeatured`/`featureRank`, `Image` `'artist'` end to end, and the admin CSV columns.

### Carried into later phases

- `isGroup` is settable through `artist.update`, which is `editorProcedure`. Section 11.1 of the plan wants it moderator-gated. That gating lands with the wizard in phase 5.
- `claimStatus` and `verifiedAt` exist on the entity but nothing writes them until phase 8.
- `EventArtist.isFeatured`/`featureRank` exist but have no setter yet; the performances modal in phase 5 owns that.

Every wizard picker added later must route through `findOrCreateArtist` rather than calling `createArtist` — that is the guard against multiplying duplicate artists. See 11.2 in the plan. When resolving a batch, fetch `listAllArtistsForMatching()` once and pass it as `candidates`; otherwise each new name sweeps the artist list again.

### Deferred from the phase 0 code review

Raised, judged real, not yet done:

- `cascadeArtistMerge`'s `ArtistAward` block is a copy of its `EventArtist` block with the nouns swapped, verbatim comment included. Both want one `migrateJunctionRows` helper, and `cascadeVenueMerge` probably does too.
- Neither block checks BatchGet `unprocessed`. If keys come back unprocessed the existence check under-reports and the upsert overwrites a canonical `ArtistAward`'s `rank`/`year`/`category`. Pre-existing, inherited by the copy.
- `dedup.ts` imports from `'.'` while `index.ts` re-exports it — a cycle, and the reason the test has to mock the barrel that exports the thing under test.
- `initialsMatch` is exported and tested but no longer called internally; `tokenMatches` absorbed its job.
- Transliteration forks (`Raghunathan`/`Ragunathan`, `Subrahmanyan`/`Subrahmanyam`) are currently rejected as a deliberate false negative. Folding `aa→a`, `ee/ii→i`, `oo/uu→u` and post-stop `h` inside `normalizeArtistName` would catch them without weakening the surname rule. Do not reach for Soundex or Metaphone — they are tuned for English orthography and collide `Krishna` with `Krishnan`.

### Known baselines (so regressions are visible)

Measured at phase 0 completion. These are pre-existing and not caused by this work:

- `packages/core`: 3 failing tests (`updateArtist`/`updateRaga`/`updateTala` "should throw error when update fails" — all three assert a capitalised message the code emits lowercase), 7 typecheck errors.
- `packages/web`: 35 typecheck errors, tests all pass.
- One pre-existing Biome formatting complaint in `cascade.ts` (`cascadeEventMergeToSetlist`) and one non-null assertion in `event.ts:413`.
