# Summary of Core Domain Implementation for Rasika.life

## Domains Implemented

I've implemented three core domains that form the foundation of the Rasika.life platform:

1. **Artist Domain**: Represents performers and composers with detailed profiles
2. **Raga Domain**: Music scale/mode entities with versioning support
3. **Tala Domain**: Rhythm pattern entities with versioning support
4. **Composition Domain**: Musical compositions with attribution system

## Key Design Patterns

Across all implementations, I've followed these consistent patterns:

### 1. Domain-Driven Design Structure

Each domain follows a consistent file structure:
- `schema.ts` - Zod schemas defining domain entities
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for domain-specific types
- `repository.ts` - Data access layer with DynamoDB operations
- `service.ts` - Business logic layer with validation/normalization
- `index.ts` - Public exports
- `*.test.ts` - Comprehensive test files

### 2. Single Table Design

Leveraged the power of DynamoDB's single-table pattern:
- Primary keys use entity prefixes (`ARTIST#id`, `RAGA#id`, etc.)
- Sort keys support versioning (`VERSION#v1#timestamp`)
- GSIs for various access patterns (search by name, type, tradition)
- Consistent naming conventions for keys

### 3. Content Versioning System

Implemented wiki-style versioning for all knowledge-base items:
- Every edit creates a new version (`v1`, `v2`, etc.)
- Latest version pointer using `VERSION#LATEST` sort key
- Version history tracking for audit trails
- Editor tracking per version

### 4. Robust Search Capabilities

Built multiple search approaches:
- Title/Name prefix searches 
- Category-based queries (tradition, language, etc.)
- Attribute-based filtering
- Relevance scoring for better results

### 5. Attribution System

Created a flexible attribution model:
- Many-to-many relationships between compositions and artists
- Support for disputed attributions
- Confidence levels (high, medium, low)
- Verification system for community validation

### 6. Normalization

Service layer handles data normalization:
- Standardized name formatting
- Language normalization
- Entity type standardization
- Consistent data structures

### 7. Analytics Support

Implemented view tracking and popularity:
- View count incrementation
- Popularity score calculation
- Structure for future analytics

## Code Reuse and DRY Principles

The implementation maintains DRY principles through:

1. **Shared Type System**: Using Zod schema inference for types
2. **Reusable Repository Patterns**: Common DB access patterns
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to errors
4. **Utility Function Reuse**: Leveraging core utility functions

## Testing Strategy

Implemented comprehensive tests for:
1. **Repository Layer**: Mocked DB operations
2. **Service Layer**: Mocked repository calls
3. **Edge Cases**: Handling errors, not found scenarios
4. **Validation**: Testing schema validation

## Implementation Notes

### Artist Domain
- Basic artist profile management
- Support for different artist types (individual, group)
- Search by name, instrument, tradition

### Raga Domain
- Complete versioning system
- Search by name, melakarta number
- View count tracking

### Tala Domain
- Similar pattern to ragas
- Search by name, aksharas (beats), type

### Composition Domain
- Core composition entity with versions
- Attribution system for composers
- Search by title, language, tradition
- Support for disputed attributions

## Next Steps for Future Development

1. **Additional Domains**:
   - Event domain for concerts
   - Performance domain for tracking specific performances
   - User domain for authentication
   - Venue domain for concert locations

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Advanced search with Elasticsearch
   - User favorites and recommendations
   - Artist grouping and relationships
   - Performance tracking

3. **Integration**:
   - Connect domains through relationships
   - Implement bulk upload scripts
   - Create frontend components for data display

4. **Analytics**:
   - Enhanced popularity algorithms
   - Trending compositions
   - User engagement metrics

## Key Code Patterns to Reuse

When implementing new domains, follow these patterns:

1. Define Zod schemas first, then infer types
2. Create repository with basic CRUD operations
3. Implement service layer with business logic
4. Build comprehensive tests for all functionality
5. Leverage existing utilities and access patterns

This foundation provides a solid base for building the rest of the Rasika.life platform, with consistent patterns that can be extended to new domains while maintaining code quality and testability.
